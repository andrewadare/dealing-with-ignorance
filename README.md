Presentation on Bayesian statistical inference for the PhET simulations group at CU Boulder. Slides were written for Reveal.js using the Jade template engine.

To view these slides, the full Reveal.js [installation](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/#installation) should be placed or linked next to index.html. I used version 3.2.0.
